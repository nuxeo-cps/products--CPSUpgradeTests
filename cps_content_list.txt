CPS Contents List
=================

This file lists all the contents that you would typically create in a CPS
site to test the upgrades. It's listed product by product. The CPS versions
that the product is valid for are listed after the product name.

CPSCore/CPSDefault
------------------
I'm not sure what kinds of tests should be done here....


CPSCalendar + CPSSharedCalendar 
-------------------------------
Since CPSCalendar gets migrated to CPSSharedCalendar, the test for them
is the same. Therefore, the content that should be created is the same.

- A home calendar for the manager (gets created when you go to cps/logged_in).

- A Workspace calendar in /workspaces/ with id 'workspace_calendar'

- A Resource calendar in /workspaces/ with id 'resource_calendar'

- Create a private/personal event in the managers calendar, with the title 
  "Private Event".
  
- Create a meeting in the managers calendar inviting both the workspace
  calendar and the resource calendar. Call the event "Meeting".
  
- Create a weekly recurring event in the workspace calendar, that occurs 
  five times, for example, having it's first occurence 2006-03-03 and it's
  last occurrence the 2006-03-31. 
  For a CPSCalendar event, that means a weekly event starting at 
  2006-03-03 15:00 and ending at 2006-03-31 16:00.
  For a CPSSharedCalendar event, that means an event starting at
  2006-03-03 15:00 and ending at 2006-03-03 16:00, and having it's number of
  recurrences set to 5 (or the reccuring end date to 2006-03-31).
